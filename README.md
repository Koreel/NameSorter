# Name_Sorter

This is the documentation for the Name Sorter program. The program is designed to sort a list of names that are provided in a text file. This project was made to showcase my understanding of SOLID principles with .NET.

To use the program, follow these instructions:

Run the program.
When prompted, enter the following command: name-sorter <filename>
Replace <filename> with the name of the file that contains the list of names you want to sort.
You can provide a relative or absolute path to the file, or use ./ to specify the current directory.
For example, if you have a file named "names.txt" in the current directory, you can use the following command:


name-sorter ./unsorted-names.txt
After you enter the command, the program will sort the names and display them in alphabetical order. If there are any errors or issues, the program will display an error message.

Thank you for using the Name Sorter program!
